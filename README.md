# GIVHUB By SHRKD

GivHub is an Angular Web Application that assists users in fullfilling their charitable aspirations. With access to data on over 2 million charities, GivHub can be used to discover organizations supporting many causes. By creating an account, one may subscribe to charity pages, establishing a singular hub linking users to operations of personalized interest.  We expect to attract donators who lack experience in determining quality organizations, so we are including a best-practices page informing our users how to ascertain that their contributions will best reach their conerns.  For our users' convenience, we will maintain records of their donations; assisting them in reaching annual goals.  A planned social feature will expose friends to eachothers interests, as well as connect like-concerned individuals within a regional proximity.  Finally, with a backlog of features focused on being ever-more informative to our users, our team hopes to become a reliable resource for those interested in commiting charitable contributions.

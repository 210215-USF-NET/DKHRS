# GIVHUB By SHRKD

GivHub is an Angular Web Application that assists users in fulfilling their charitable aspirations. With access to data on over 2 million charities, GivHub can be used to discover organizations supporting many causes. By creating an account, one may subscribe to charity pages, establishing a direct connection between users and organizations of interest. Included in our application is a help page to guide users on making informed donations and ensure their contribution is reaching organizations that tackle matters important to them. For our users' convenience, our application keeps track of their total donations, including a record list where users can see those who've donated the most and how much they've donated in total. A planned social feature is currently being worked on that will allow users to follow others, view the charities they've subscribed to, and discover charities similar to their interests. With more features planned in development, our team hopes to deliver the best possible experience to users as they explore GivHub's resources. We look forward to serving your charitable needs.
